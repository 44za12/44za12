### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Aazar, a software engineer with 6+ years of experience in solving complex problems and designing scalable solutions who holds a global rank 1 on HackerRank in Python.

Currently I work in [Nykaa](https://www.nykaa.com) as a Senior Software Engineer where I take on the most revenue impacting problems and design a solution for them.

I am finally trying my hands at C++ which is quite new for me given my lifelong dependency on Python which slighly changed around 2 years back when I started with Golang, Java and Javascript too. So far it's going great however.

I am a strong advocate of learning by building, I have built a lot of personal projects as you can see. :)

I am very much open to learning WebAssembly, haven't really gotten a chance to check that out properly yet. If you have anything in mind, do reach out,

Feel free to ask me about anything-python, I absolutely love discussing that.

I am reachable at [44za12@gmail.com](mailto:44za12@gmail.com)

My Pronouns are He/Him.

Fun Fact: I am also an avid reader, who is extremely fascinated by and love reading psychology.
